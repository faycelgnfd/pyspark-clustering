# pyspark-clustering

This notebook was created while having the first hand on pyspark. During this process, we manipulated generated data using pyspark's RDD and pyspark dataframe, used sql requests to do data analyses and visualisations.

The main goal of the task was to compare the MLlib clustering methodes and the implemented clustering algorithme that uses pyspark fucntions.
